Project Name: sim3dof
Three degree of freedom (3DOF) missile simulation

Features:

 - Object oriented design with simulation models derived from a common base
   class with virtual methods.

 - Base class provides RK4 integrator for dynamic models

 - Initial simulation is a planar 3DOF with X, Y, theta (pitch/yaw) degrees of
   freedom

 - The plan is to convert to an X, Y, Z 3DOF with a second order angular
   dynamics model.
